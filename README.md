# CS230-Gaming-Room-Project
### Who was the client, and what kind of software did they want you to make?
The client was The Gaming Room. They made a game called *Draw It or Lose It* for Android, and they wanted to turn it into a web-based game that works on different devices like phones, tablets, and computers. They needed it to be easy to use, run smoothly, and allow multiple teams to play at once with real-time updates.

### What did you do well in your documentation?
I made sure to include important details like how each team and player needs a unique name, how the system will handle real-time updates, and how the game will stay secure.

### What was helpful about creating this design document when working on the code?
Writing the design document helped me plan things out before jumping into the code. It showed me how everything should work together, which made coding easier and more organized.

### If you could change one part of your document, what would it be and how would you fix it?
I would try to explain the system layout more clearly. I’d add a simple drawing or diagram to show how the game connects across different devices. That would make it easier to understand how the whole system works.

### How did you understand what the users needed and add that into your design? Why is that important?
I thought about what the players would need for the game to be fun and easy to play. I made sure the game would be fast, safe, and work on all kinds of devices. It’s important to think about the user because if the game is hard to use or has issues, people won’t want to play it.

### How did you design your software? What would you do again next time?
I broke the project into smaller pieces and used object-oriented design, which helped keep the code neat and reusable. Next time, I’d still use diagrams and planning tools like UML to map things out first. It really helps to see how everything fits together before coding.
